Feature Volatility Analysis was performed with the longitudinal plugin for Qiime2 (Bokulich, Dillon et al. 2018) 
on ASV-level and Phylum-level ASV tables together with clinical values and calculated α-diversity as features. 
A time-index was introduced, to describe the time range of this study monthly as rational numbers and to align all patients accordingly to their age. 
The time-index was used as the state column and grouping of the longitudinal analysis was based on the affiliation to the "Stable" or "Decliner patients' group. 
The n_estimators input value was set to 1000, and Random Forest Regression was used as an estimator by default. 

In the “Feature Volatility Analysis,” the program uses the structure of the data as a learning input for a machine learning algorithm.
The data was analyses patient-specific because we set the “individual_id_column” to the patient names.
The algorithms identify the features (in our case, the ASV or Phyla) which are the most important ones in the prediction 
of different states (states = time points). The abundance of the identified important ASV or Phyla is predictive for a specific time.
This method can help to identify potential relevant ASV and Phyla. 

However, to interpret the global importance of the feature on the entirety, 
the abundance a global variance or global mean should also be considered.
